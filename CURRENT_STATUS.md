# GitHub Agent Current Status

## Working Implementation
- Browser-based UI with command processing
- Successfully integrated with GitHub API
- Core file operations implemented

## Command Interface
```bash
# Create/update files
write <filename> <content>

# Read file contents
read <filename>

# List directory contents
list [path]

# Show latest commit
status

# Create new branch
branch <branchname>
```

## API Integration
Commands are processed via POST requests to `/api/github` with the structure:
```javascript
{
  name: 'function_name',  // e.g. 'push_files'
  parameters: {
    owner: 'AIWhisper',
    repo: 'github-agent',
    // ... other parameters as needed
  }
}
```

## Verified Operations
- âœ… Writing files (`write` command)
- ðŸ”„ Other commands need testing

## Next Steps
1. Test all remaining commands thoroughly
2. Add error handling for edge cases
3. Improve response formatting
4. Add multi-file operations support
