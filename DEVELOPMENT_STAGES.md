# Development Stages

## Current Stage: Command Parsing Integration

### Completed
- Basic file operations (read/write)
- Initial command structure
- Chat integration framework

### In Progress
- Claude command parsing implementation
- Integration between chat and GitHub operations

### Next Steps
1. Implement command parsing in chat interface
2. Test basic end-to-end operations
3. Add more essential commands
4. Thorough testing of all operations

### Implementation Notes
- Using simple command syntax (e.g., 'read filename')
- Maintaining stateful operations between chats
- Focusing on reliability over feature completeness

### Command Structure
Commands are parsed in the format:
`command [argument1] [argument2] [...argumentN]`

Example:
`write test.txt This is the content`
