# GitHub Agent Development Continuation

## Quick Start
The GitHub agent is now functional with a working browser interface. Key operations:

```bash
# Test basic file operation
write test.txt "Hello World"

# Verify file contents
read test.txt
```

## Current Priority
Needs thorough testing of all operations:
1. File reading/writing
2. Directory listing
3. Branch creation
4. Status checks

## Recent Changes
- Implemented correct API integration via fetch
- Fixed function invocation issues
- Added proper parameter handling

## Development Branch
Latest commit: a2d91ca (Write operation working)

Ready to proceed with comprehensive testing and additional feature implementation.
