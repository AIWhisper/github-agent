# GitHub Agent Testing Progress

## Completed Tests

### Write Operations
- Basic file writes ✓
- Unicode content handling ✓
- Special characters in content ✓
- Nested directory creation ✓
- Multiple file operations ✓
- File overwrites ✓
- Error handling for failed writes ✓

### File Overwrite Testing
- Basic overwrites (single file) ✓
- Rapid successive updates ✓
- Multi-file overwrites ✓
- Atomic commit verification ✓
- Error handling ✓

## Remaining Test Areas

1. Large File Operations
   - Test size limits
   - Performance with large files
   - Chunked uploads if needed

2. Concurrent Operations
   - Multiple simultaneous writes
   - Race condition testing
   - Conflict resolution

3. Edge Cases with File Naming
   - Special characters in paths
   - Maximum path lengths
   - Reserved names

4. Error Recovery Scenarios
   - Network interruption handling
   - Partial operation recovery
   - State consistency after errors

## Next Steps
1. Begin testing large file operations
2. Implement concurrent operation tests
3. Systematically test file naming edge cases
4. Develop error recovery testing suite
