# GitHub Agent

A specialized GitHub operations service designed to be used by general AI agents for consistent and reliable GitHub interactions.

## Purpose

This agent provides a standardized interface for handling GitHub operations, making it easier for general AI agents to:
- Execute GitHub operations consistently
- Handle errors gracefully
- Maintain state between operations
- Get predictable response formats

## Architecture

### 1. GitHub Service (`github-service.js`)
Core service layer that handles:
- Direct GitHub API interactions
- Robust error handling
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Operation state management
- Standardized response formats

```javascript
// Example service usage
const githubService = require('./github-service');

// Operations return consistent response format
const response = await githubService.writeFile('test.txt', 'content');
// {
//   success: true,
//   data: "Successfully updated test.txt"
// }
```

### 2. Agent Interface (`src/ui/components/GitHubAgentInterface`)
Provides a structured interface specification for:
- Available commands (write, read, list, status)
- Required inputs for each operation
- Expected response formats
- Error handling patterns

The interface component serves as both documentation and a contract for how general agents should interact with this specialized GitHub agent.

## Integration Guide

### For General Agents

1. **Operation Types**
   - `write`: Create or update files
   - `read`: Retrieve file contents
   - `list`: Get directory contents
   - `status`: Check agent configuration

2. **Response Format**
```javascript
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: any,
  error?: string,
  context?: {
    operation: string,
    timestamp: string,
    ...additional context
  }
}
```

3. **Error Handling**
   - All operations include built-in retries
   - Exponential backoff for rate limits
   - Detailed error context
   - Consistent error response format

## Security

- Scoped permissions
- Configurable retry limits
- Operation logging
- Error tracing

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Enhanced operation logging
- [ ] Expanded GitHub API coverage
- [ ] Configurable operation timeouts
- [ ] Operation batching support
- [ ] Advanced state persistence
