# New Chat Summary

For continuing development of the GitHub agent, here's what you need to know:

## Current State
- Basic GitHub operations implemented and working
- Browser-based interface available
- Direct API integration functioning

## Key Files
- `github-agent-browser.html`: Main implementation with UI
- `STATUS.md`: Current status and next steps

## Immediate Tasks
1. Test and validate all basic operations
2. Add error handling for edge cases
3. Implement additional features as needed

## Usage Example
```bash
# Create/update file
write test.txt Hello World

# Read file
read test.txt

# List contents
list
```

The agent is functional for basic operations and ready for further development.
