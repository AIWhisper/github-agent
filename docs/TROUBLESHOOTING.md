# PR Interface Troubleshooting Log

## Current Issue: Button Click Not Working
The main PR interface button highlights on mouseover but doesn't respond to clicks.

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. Initial Setup
   - Created React interface for PR management
   - Implemented with shadcn/ui components
   - Added form validation and error handling

2. First Debug Attempt
   - Added console logging
   - Modified error handling
   - No response from button clicks
   - Button visually responds to hover states

3. Component Isolation Test
   - Created minimal test component
   - Removed complex form logic
   - Button still unresponsive to clicks
   - Hover states working correctly

4. HTML Element Testing
   - Created test interface with different button implementations:
     - Regular HTML button
     - Button with preventDefault
     - Clickable div
   - Purpose: Isolate if issue is specific to shadcn/ui or more fundamental

### Current Status
- Basic HTML buttons are responding to clicks
- Identified that issue was specific to shadcn/ui Button component implementation

### Next Steps
1. Implementation Tasks:
   - Rebuild PR interface using basic HTML buttons
   - Add styling to match design
   - Re-implement form validation
   - Add error handling
   - Test API endpoints

2. Testing Required:
   - Verify click handlers
   - Test form submission
   - Validate API responses
   - Check error scenarios

### Environment Details
- React frontend
- Express backend
- shadcn/ui components
- Local development environment

### Notes
- Button hover states working correctly indicates CSS and basic event handling is functional
