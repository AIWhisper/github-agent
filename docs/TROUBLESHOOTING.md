## Current Issue: Button Click Event Handler
**Status**: Under Investigation
**Date Started**: January 11, 2025
**Component**: Main navigation button in Header component

### Issue Description
The button click event handler in the main navigation is not responding to user interactions. This affects the primary navigation functionality of the application.

### Steps Taken
1. Verified the issue occurs consistently when clicking the button
   - Tested across Chrome and Firefox
   - Issue reproduces 100% of the time
2. Confirmed basic HTML buttons work as expected
   - Tested with a simple `<button>` element
   - Plain HTML button events trigger correctly
3. Isolated the problem to the event handler implementation
   - Current implementation uses custom hooks for event handling
   - No errors appear in browser console

### Environment Details
- Browser: Latest Chrome/Firefox
- React Version: 18.x
- Dependencies:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS

### Relevant Code
```typescript
// Current problematic implementation
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  // Event handler code here
}, []);

// Component usage
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Navigate</Button>
```

### Console Output
No errors or warnings observed in browser console during button interactions.
