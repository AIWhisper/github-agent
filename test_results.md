# Command Parser Test Results

## Initial Test Run
Identified issue: REPL environment needs direct API access rather than file imports.

## Modified Test Approach
1. Test GitHub API commands directly
2. Verify command parsing patterns
3. Test response formatting

## Next Steps
1. Integrate parser with Claude's built-in GitHub functions
2. Add error handling for malformed commands
3. Implement response formatting
